## Overview

This directory contains archived task lists and change notes from TODO.md. When TODO.md accumulates completed tasks or a major topic is finished, tasks are moved here to maintain a clean working task list while preserving history.

**See:** [TODO_MD_ARCHIVAL_PROTOCOL.md](../.claude/protocols/TODO_MD_ARCHIVAL_PROTOCOL.md) for archival process.
