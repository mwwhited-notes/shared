## Software

- **AmScope Camera Software** - Windows 8.1/10/11, macOS, Linux

## Notes

The SM-3 head can be mounted on various stands (table stand, boom stand, etc.). With the 0.5X and 2X Barlow lenses, the full magnification range spans 3.5X to 90X.

**Not simul-focal** - Light is directed either to the eyepieces OR the camera port (unlike the T490-DK which allows simultaneous viewing).

Magnification calculations:
- Base: Objective (0.7X-4.5X) × Eyepiece (10X) = 7X-45X
- With 0.5X Barlow: 3.5X-22.5X
- With 2X Barlow: 14X-90X
