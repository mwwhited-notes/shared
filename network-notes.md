## some notes

HP 34401A, Rigol DM3058E and DG1022 do not have LXI... 
    though one of my project ideas is to build and LXI bridge for all of my test equipment.  the idea would be to 
    have a web interface for controlling/viewing all of the test equipment as well as having an IP socket for SCPI access
