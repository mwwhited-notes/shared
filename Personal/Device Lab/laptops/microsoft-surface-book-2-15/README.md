2. **Field editing** - Quick adjustments and culling on location
3. **Tablet mode** - Use Surface Pen for precise selections and masking
4. **Sync to desktop** - Transfer edited files to PowerSpec G474 for final processing

**Advantages:**
- High-resolution screen (3240x2160) for detailed preview
- GTX 1060 accelerates Lightroom/Photoshop
- SD card reader for quick imports
- Detachable mode for comfortable pen work

## Software

**Installed Applications:**
- Adobe Lightroom Classic
- Adobe Photoshop
- Capture One (alternative)
- DxO PhotoLab
- Surface app (for pen/touch customization)
