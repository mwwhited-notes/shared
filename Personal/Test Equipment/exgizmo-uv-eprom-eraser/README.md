- UV-curable materials

## Usage Notes

### Erase Times (Typical)

| Device Type | Approximate Time |
|-------------|------------------|
| 27C64 | 15-20 minutes |
| 27C256 | 15-20 minutes |
| 27C512 | 20-30 minutes |
| Larger EPROMs | 30+ minutes |

**Note:** Times vary based on UV intensity and previous erase cycles.

### Safety

- Do not look directly at UV light
- Ensure safety interlock works before use
- Keep away from skin/eyes
- Let EPROMs cool before programming
