## How It Works

The D2-1 uses infrared sensors to detect a dark line on a light surface:
1. IR LEDs illuminate the surface
2. Phototransistors detect reflected light
3. Comparator circuit determines line position
4. H-bridge controls motors to steer toward the line

## Applications

- Electronics education
- Soldering practice
- Understanding basic control systems
- Introduction to robotics concepts
