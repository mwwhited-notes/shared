## Design Philosophy

The Gigatron contains:
- **No microprocessor** - CPU built from discrete 7400 logic
- **No video chip** - Video generated by CPU
- **No sound chip** - Audio generated by CPU
- **No I/O chips** - All peripherals handled by CPU

## Features

- Complete 8-bit computer from TTL gates
- VGA video output
- Synthesized audio
- Built-in games (Tetris, Snake, etc.)
- BASIC interpreter
- ROM-based software library
- Expansion port for peripherals
- Educational assembly experience

## Components

Key ICs in the design:
- 74HCT00 (NAND gates)
- 74HCT04 (Inverters)
- 74HCT138 (Decoder)
- 74HCT157 (Multiplexers)
- 74HCT161 (Counters)
- 74HCT273 (Registers)

## Notes

The Gigatron demonstrates that a functional computer can be built without a microprocessor chip. The CPU performs all video, audio, and I/O tasks through careful cycle-by-cycle programming. Created by Marcel van Kervinck (1969-2020) and Walter Belgers.

Production is being discontinued after current stock is sold.
