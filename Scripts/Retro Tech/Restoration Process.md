# Suggested Evaluation and Restoration Process for Vintage Electronics

## Summary

I want to help get the Systron Donner SD-80 at System Source Computer Museum back up an running...
I'm looking for a recommended procedure for firing up old electronics? I want to avoid a fireworks and smoke show as much as possible.

## Planned process for restoration

1. Physical Evaluation:
    - Document any material defects, leaks, damage along the way
    - Document Device Exterior
    - Remove sub modules, document current device status
    - Open access panels, evaluate wiring, cables, connectors and insulation
    - Review capacitors
