review all code, documents and scripts. you should be able to create a summary of what documents are generated 
and what are hand written.  i would like an index file created in the .\docs folder so you can tell which is 
which.  I would also like a full architecture review of the framework under .\src.  once that is done do a 
comparison between .\src and .\common to find feature that exist in .\common but  not in .\src I would like a 
reports created under .\docs\proposal\features\{epic-name}\{feature-name}.md that includes the missing items. 
there should also be plans to start a migraion of missing features. new patterns must follow the coding 
standards as the yare already in .\src ... create a .\docs\architecture\... section to cover patterns and 
practices as well as the current structure.  where possible all files should be created in markdown with 
plantuml and either plantuml+salt or ascii art for example user interfaces.  if you create any protocols they 
should be created under .\.claude\protocols
