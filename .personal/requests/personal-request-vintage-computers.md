# Personal Request: Vintage Computers Inventory

## What We Need

Current inventory of vintage computer systems and peripherals from Personal/Vintage Computers collection.

## Use Case

`workshop-capabilities.md` and project ideas reference vintage computers for preservation, emulation, and restoration projects. This information is critical for:
- Documenting available retro systems and their specifications
- Tracking disk collections and media compatibility
- Planning preservation and archival projects
- Cross-referencing peripheral compatibility
- Planning emulation and FPGA soft-core projects
- Identifying systems available for retrobrewing or upgrades

## Information to Extract From Personal/Vintage Computers/

For each vintage computer system, provide:

### System Information
- Computer model and year manufactured
- Processor type and speed
- RAM configuration and expandability
- Storage options (floppy drives, hard drives, ROM capacity)
- Expansion slots available
- Display capabilities (video output type)
- Peripherals included/available
- Current condition and status (Working/For Repair/Parts/Collecting)

### Peripheral & Accessory Information
- Peripheral name and model
- Compatibility (which systems it works with)
- Current status and condition
- Related storage media available

2. **Disk Collections** - Floppy disks, hard drives, media for specific systems
   - System compatibility
   - Disk count/media type
   - Condition/readability status
   - Archival tools available (Greaseweazle, etc.)

3. **Display Equipment** - Monitors, CRTs, RGB adapters
   - Type and compatibility
   - Resolution/specs

4. **Storage Devices** - Disk drives, controllers, adapters
   - Type (3.5", 5.25", 8")
   - Capacity and interface (IDE, SCSI, parallel port, etc.)
   - Status and compatibility

5. **Expansion Cards** - RAM upgrades, graphics cards, controller cards
   - Type and capacity
   - Slot compatibility
   - Status

6. **I/O & Interface Equipment** - Parallel adapters, USB bridges, serial converters
   - Type and compatibility

## Cross-Reference Notes

- Which restoration/preservation projects are actively using specific systems
- Media archival status (which disks have been backed up, which need archival)
- Emulation project potential (FPGA soft-cores, SoC implementations)
- Expansion possibilities (RAM upgrades, CF cards, networking adapters)
- Any unique or collectible items in the inventory
- Storage media and condition (important for long-term preservation planning)
