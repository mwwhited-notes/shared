# Personal Request: Device Lab Inventory

## What We Need

Current inventory of computing devices from Personal/Device Lab collection for use in root repository documentation.

## Use Case

`workshop-capabilities.md` documents available devices and their capabilities. Currently showing placeholder/generic data. Need actual current inventory to:
- Document what devices are available for projects
- Track which devices are hackable (root/jailbreak/CFW status)
- Identify devices available for repurposing projects
- Cross-reference with home-automation and other root projects
- Plan device-based project ideas

## Information to Extract From Personal/Device Lab/

### Workstations & Servers
- Device/system name and model
- Specifications (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU if applicable)
- Current use/status
- Project potential
- OS and customization options

### Mobile Devices (Hackable)
- Device type and model
- Hackability status (root available? jailbreak? CFW?)
- Custom firmware options if available
- Project ideas for device
- Integration with home-automation or other projects

### Network Storage
- Device model and capacity
- Current configuration
- Primary use
- Expansion possibilities

### Other Computing Devices
- Any other devices being used for tinkering/repurposing
- Current project status
- Specifications and hackability

## Format Requested

Two markdown tables:

**Table 1: Workstations & Servers**
| System | Specs | Use | OS/Customization |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

**Table 2: Mobile Devices (Hackable)**
| Device | Status | Hackability | Project Potential |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

**Table 3: Network Storage**
| Device | Capacity | Use | Expansion |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

Plus any additional devices/notes.

## Cross-Reference Notes

- Link any devices to specific projects in root /projects/ that use them
- Note which devices support home-automation integration
- Identify any devices reserved for specific planned projects

## Response File Location

Place completed inventory at: `personal/incoming/device-lab.md`
