## Restoration & Maintenance

### System Condition Notes

**Age-Related Considerations (35-40+ years old):**
- Capacitor replacement often needed (electrolytic degradation common)
- Power supply performance may degrade
- Disk drive mechanisms may require cleaning/lubrication
- Display/video output may need verification
- All systems should be power-cycled carefully

### Preventive Maintenance

| Item | Frequency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Visual inspection | Quarterly | Check for corrosion/damage |
| Power-up test | Semi-annual | Verify function before storage |
| Capacitor monitoring | As-needed | Early detection of aging issues |
| Storage environment | Continuous | Temperature 18-24°C, humidity 40-50% |

### Restoration Resources

- Original service manuals available locally
- Replacement capacitor kits marketed for vintage systems
- Online communities (6502.org, VintageComputers forum)
