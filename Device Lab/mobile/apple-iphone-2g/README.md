## Notes

- **Collectible value**: Original iPhones in good condition are increasingly valuable
- **Battery**: After 15+ years, battery likely needs replacement or is degraded
- **Cellular**: 2G networks largely shut down - WiFi only in most regions
- **Apps**: Most modern apps won't run - limited to legacy/jailbreak apps
