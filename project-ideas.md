* Designing my own CPU/computer (and learn system verilog) [I have most of the ALU and a text graphics engine from a few years ago.]
* build out that clock (attiny2313) [the new LED screen showed up so I can solder it up now and I need to tweak the counter to see if I can get it to keep time better.]  This project was mostly about building something semiuseful with an ATTiny and learning how to built out the ISP (In-circuit
  Serial Programmer) interface
* play around with SCPI (standard commands for programmable interments) to control the test equipment on my bench and probably write my own VISA driver for .Net Core (might also build a RS-232/ethernet gateway or USB them into a raspberry pi/beagle bone black)
* build out an analog computer/integrator (opamps for math because why not)
* build out multi-axis hand controller to work with oculus/hololens
* design and build a handheld/bench to calculator that will also function as a simple I/O interface for parallel and serial interfaces
* write a simple game for the NES and Apple II (program in 6502 assembly)
* build out a UI for an Intel 8085 trainer
* play around with SoC (system on a chip) based on the Xilinx Zync Z7
* play around more with diode logic (working though this in combination with trying to reverse engineer programming some old PAL chips helped me understand how "high voltage" programmers work as well as ROM, SRAM, and more about combinational logic
