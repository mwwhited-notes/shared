# Ideas for Streaming Channel 

## Description 

I want to setup something like the `choose your own adventure` program
I rant at Loghter/Eliassen.  

## Notes

  - probably discord to start so I can have bidirectional audio
- [ ] Record incoming audio seperate so it can be stripped from recordings.
  - Restate questions and suggestions in my own voice.
- [ ] setup OBS
  - [ ] Bench camera
  - [ ] raw screen capture
  - [ ] arduino studio
  - [ ] visual studio
  - [ ] edit marker drop shortcut
  - [ ] keep second audio marker drop shortcut
  - [ ] look into stream deck controller
  - [ ] look into second presenter
- [ ] look into nonprofit status
- [ ] move business
  - [ ] shutdown in ohio?
  - [ ] form in MD or DE?
  - [ ] should it be nonprofit
    - intention is to share ideas with community
