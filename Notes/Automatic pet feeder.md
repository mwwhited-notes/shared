Here is a quick guide for operation. The "manual" is terrible to follow, and God forbid you should lose it!

## SETTING THE CLOCK

1. Turn feeder on.
2. Within 90 seconds, set time:
3. Press "Clock" to set hour / press "Timer" to set minute
4. Press "Set" to confirm.
5. Press "Clock" to toggle between 12/24 hours.
6. Press "Start" to confirm clock settings.

## PROGRAMMING THE FEEDINGS

1. Display now shows "1 07" (first feeding at 07am)
2. Press "Set" for two seconds until display flashes.
3. Press "Timer" to set desired feeding time.
4. Press "Set" to program second feeding time.
5. Press "Timer" to set next desired feeding time.
6. To finish your programming press "Start" to save and exit.

*Note:* If you pressed the SET key a 3rd time, but you did not want a 3rd feeding, press TIMER and then press and hold SET for 2 seconds to start over. Remember not to press the SET key after the second feeding and press START to end your feeding scheduling.

*Note:*

1. 07 = 1st feeding at 7am
2. 12 = 2nd feeding at noon

## SETTING THE VOLUME/PORTION SIZE

1. Press the VOL key to display the feed size
2. Press and hold for 2 seconds the SET key until digit 4 blinks
3. Press the VOL key to set the dispense amount. 1= 1/4 cup (for larger kibble), 2= 1/2 cup, 3= 3/4 cup ... 9= 2 1/4 cups, 0 (zero) = 2 1/2 cups.
4. Press START to confirm

*Note:* For smaller kibble (cats) each portion is closer to 1/3 of a cup instead of 1/4.

## SETTING THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO FEED

1. The default setting is "0" which equals (counter-intuitively) unlimited non-stop.
2. Press DAY to display the number of days (remember "0" means unlimited).
3. Press and hold SET for 2 seconds until days flash
4. Press DAY to change the number of days, hold to speed through.
5. Press START to confirm

*Note:* The unit will beep when the cycle is finished.

## TO END ALL PROGRAMMING (without turning off the clock and losing settings)

1. Press SET and START keys together

## TO REVIEW YOUR SETTINGS

1. Press TIMER to cycle through and view the feeding times
2. Press VOL key once to display the portion size and feeding days remaining
3. Press CLOCK once to view the current time
