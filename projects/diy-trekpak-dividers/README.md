# DIY TrekPak-Style Dividers

Custom drawer and parts case dividers for organizing components - a DIY alternative to [Pelican's TrekPak system](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/discover/trekpak).

## Overview

TrekPak uses corrugated plastic with foam lamination and steel U-pins for modular, reconfigurable case organization. This DIY version replicates that concept with readily available materials at a fraction of the cost.

## Materials

All materials documented in [tools-and-components.md](../../tools-and-components.md#craft--project-supplies).

| Material | Purpose | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| U-shaped hair pins (2.4" brown) | Locking pins - similar to TrekPak's steel U-pins | IKOCO, 80pcs, $6.13 ea |
| EVA foam sheets/rolls (3mm) | Padding, divider material, cushioning | BENECREAT, 78.7x11.8", $14.89-$15.79 |
| Felt tape (self-adhesive) | Soft lining, scratch prevention | Pllieay, 1.96x14.7ft, $7.99 |
| Corrugated plastic panels | Rigid divider walls (like political sign material) | TBD |

**Total materials cost:** ~$60-70 (3 packs hair pins, 2 foam rolls, 1 felt tape roll)

*Compare to commercial TrekPak: $80-150+ per case insert*

## Construction Method

1. **Measure your container** - Drawer, case, or toolbox dimensions
2. **Cut corrugated plastic** to fit container dimensions
   - Use utility knife or box cutter
   - Cut pieces for vertical dividers and base panels
3. **Create divider slots**
   - Align corrugation channels horizontally
   - Hair pins insert through channels to lock dividers in place
4. **Apply felt tape**
   - Line edges that contact container walls
   - Prevents scratches and adds cushioning
5. **Add EVA foam padding**
   - Cut to size for bottom padding
   - Custom shapes for delicate items
   - Can create foam-lined compartments

## Key Features

### U-Pin Locking System
- Hair pins function like TrekPak's steel U-pins
- Insert through corrugation channels at intersections
- Create adjustable grid of compartments
- Easily reconfigured without tools

### Modular Design
- Dividers can be repositioned by moving pins
- No permanent attachments
- Works with any drawer/case size

## Advantages Over Commercial TrekPak

| Feature | DIY TrekPak | Commercial TrekPak |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cost | ~$60-70 | $80-150+ per insert |
| Compatibility | Any drawer/case/container | Specific Pelican cases only |
| Customization | Fully customizable sizes | Fixed case dimensions |
| Materials | Readily available | Proprietary system |
| Assembly | Simple cutting/assembly | Pre-cut panels |

## Use Cases

- Electronics component storage (resistors, ICs, connectors)
- Tool drawer organization
- Camera equipment cases
- Workshop parts bins
- Portable project cases
- Shipping/transport cases

## Project Status

**Status:** Reference/As Needed

Materials are acquired and ready to use whenever drawer/case organization is needed. This is not an active build project but rather a documented method and materials inventory for future organizational needs.

**How to Use:**
1. Identify drawer/case needing organization
2. Source corrugated plastic panels (or use existing stock)
3. Follow construction method in this document
4. Build custom dividers for specific application
