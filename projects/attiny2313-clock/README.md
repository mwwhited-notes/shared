# ATtiny2313 LED Clock

LED clock project using ATtiny2313 microcontroller - learning ISP programming and timekeeping.

## Overview

This project builds a semi-useful LED clock using an ATtiny2313 microcontroller. The primary learning goals are:
- Building practical circuits with ATtiny microcontrollers
- Implementing ISP (In-circuit Serial Programmer) interface
- Exploring accurate timekeeping with basic hardware
- Designing LED display drivers

The clock features a new LED screen that needs to be soldered and assembled. The counter code needs tuning to improve timekeeping accuracy.

## Project Status

**Status:** Completed

**Completed:**
- Clock circuit design and assembly
